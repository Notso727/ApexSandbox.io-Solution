public String nameFromEmail(String email) {
    //Implement a function nameFromEmail that takes as input a valid email address in the format
    // firstname.lastname@example.com. The function should extract the first name and last name from this email
    // address and return a capitalized full name (i.e. FirstName LastName). Assume that the input will always
    // be a valid email address with both the first name and last name separated by a period (.).

    //TODO Lets do this with a list and for loop

    //Create variables to collect first and last name
    String firstname;
    String lastname;

    //Lets use the substringBefore method from the String class

    firstname = email.substringBefore('.');
    lastname = email.substringBetween('.', '@');

    //Ensure all are lowercase before running capitalize in the final.

    firstname = firstname.toLowerCase();
    lastname = lastname.toLowerCase();
